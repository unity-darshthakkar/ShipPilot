/**
 * Public-page SEO — what search engines, AI answer engines, and link previews
 * see for this app.
 *
 * Two consumers read this file, so the values can never disagree:
 *   - `<Seo {...seo} path="/" />` in src/pages/index.tsx renders them at
 *     runtime (React 19 hoists <title>/<meta>/<link> into <head>);
 *   - prerender.ts (app root, via vite.config.ts) stamps them into the static
 *     HTML at `vite build`, so crawlers that do not run JavaScript still get a
 *     real title, description, and canonical URL.
 *
 * Fill `title` and `description` when you design the landing page: a headline
 * with a category descriptor ("Acme | Team task boards") and one plain
 * sentence of about 150 characters. Set `noindex: true` for an app that
 * should stay out of search engines and AI crawlers entirely (the build then
 * publishes a Disallow-all robots.txt and no sitemap).

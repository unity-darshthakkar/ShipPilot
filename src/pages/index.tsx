/**
 * Landing page — a STATIC page.
 *
 * It lives at the top level of src/pages/ (not under (app)/), so it renders
 * with no DeepSpace providers: no auth session fetch, no records WebSocket.
 * That makes it cheap to serve and safe for logged-out / crawler traffic.
 *
 * Need live data or auth here? Move this file to src/pages/(app)/index.tsx
 * and it becomes a dynamic page. Conversely, any page you want to keep static
 * (marketing, docs, legal) belongs at this top level.
 *
 * Top-level pages are also prerendered to static HTML at build
 * (prerender.ts, via vite.config.ts) so crawlers read real content.
 * Keep them renderable without a browser: no window/document during render,
 * prose in HTML text, reveal animations in CSS keyframes rather than JS-driven
 * initial states. `<Seo>` comes first and reads src/seo.ts.
